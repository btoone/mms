# Overview #

This project contains the style sheet I use for Multimarkdown documents as well as an example document that provides a good base of content to work with when testing new styles.  For fun, I incorporated the Lobster font from the [Google Font Directory](http://code.google.com/webfonts) for the headings.

# Usage #

## Multimarkdown ##

First you'll need to install Multimarkdown.  See the [site](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) for instructions on how to do that.

You'll also need the [TextMate bundle](http://fletcher.github.com/markdown.tmbundle/) to generate the previews using MMD and not the built in Markdown

## Style Sheet ##

To use the style sheet simple link to it in the meta section of your markdown file.  See the example for details

    CSS:    http://github.com/btoone/mmd-stylesheet/raw/master/mmd.css

My workflow is to edit a MMD file in TextMate and the preview it (ctrl + opt + cmd + p).  This renders the MMD file as HTML and uses the linked style sheet.  However there are several ways to render the HTML, see the [MMD site](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) for details.
