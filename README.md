# Overview #

This project contains the style sheet I use for Multimarkdown documents as well as an example document that provides a good base of content to work with when testing new styles.  For fun, I incorporated the Lobster font from the [Google Font Directory](http://code.google.com/webfonts) for the headings.

# Usage #

To use the style sheet simple link to it in the meta section of your markdown file.  See the example for details
